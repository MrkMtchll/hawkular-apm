# Hawkular APM OpenShift model files

The `YAML` files in this directory are meant to be used with OpenShift. These files can be imported via `oc create -f /path/to/file`,
where `path/to/file` might be a local path or a remote file.

While these model files can be imported into OpenShift Online, they might not work on regular accounts yet, as quotas and watchdogs might
kill the pods before they get into a healthy state. For now, the best is to use a local OpenShift cluster, which can be set on a Fedora
machine as follows:

	sudo iptables -F
	oc cluster up
	oc login -u system:admin

To import the "instant-app" template, use the `hawkular-apm-server.yml` file:

	oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-dockerfiles/hawkular-apm/master/openshift-templates/hawkular-apm-server.yml

To create a Hawkular APM deployment, use the `hawkular-apm-server-deployment.yml` file:

	oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-dockerfiles/hawkular-apm/master/openshift-templates/hawkular-apm-server-deployment.yml

Refer to the OpenShift documentation on further options for `oc create`.

The first allows an user to create an instance of Hawkular APM by customizing the service name, user name and password, while the second create a running
instance right away, using 'hawkular-apm', 'admin' and 'password' as defaults, respectively.

Note that in both cases, a service group is created composed of two services:

- hawkular-apm
- elasticsearch

The `elasticsearch` image used there is not official by any means. In fact, it's not recommended for production usage at all, as it won't persist data
between restarts. Data is replicated across the cluster, so, data will be available as long as the cluster is alive.

## Cleaning it up

To clean up the services created by the templates:

	oc delete template hawkular-apm ; \
	oc delete route hawkular-apm ; \
	oc delete deploymentconfig hawkular-apm hawkular-apm-es ; \
	oc delete serviceaccount hawkular-apm hawkular-apm-es ; \
	oc delete service hawkular-apm hawkular-apm-es
